It is a homologue of the bacterial RecA protein and forms a nucleoprotein filament with DNA. It is a DNA-dependent ATPase and is essential for the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. It is required for the repair of DNA double strand breaks in living cells, through homologous recombination. RAD51 protein is a 339-amino acid protein that is required for recombinational repair of DNA damage and maintenance of genomic stability. RAD51 interacts with many proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD52, RAD54, RAD54B, RAD55, RAD57, RPA, and DMC1.\\nRAD51 is a protein that is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. It is a homolog of the bacterial RecA protein and is a member of the RecA/RAD51 family of proteins. RAD51 is a key protein in the homologous recombination pathway, which is a major mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RAD51 is a DNA-dependent ATPase that forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA. This filament is then used to search for homologous sequences in the genome. Once a homologous sequence is found, the RAD51 filament promotes the exchange of strands between the two DNA molecules. This process is known as strand exchange and is the key step in the homologous recombination pathway. RAD51 is also involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining. In this pathway, RAD51 is thought to promote the annealing of the two broken DNA ends. RAD51 is a highly conserved protein and is found in all eukaryotes. It is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and for the maintenance of genomic stability. Mutations in the RAD51 gene have been linked to a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infertility.\\nRAD51 is a protein that is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.
