# Inference Gateway for FIRST Toolkit

FIRST (Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit) is a system that enables LLM (Large Language Model) inference as a service, allowing secure, remote execution of LLMs through an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)-compatible API. FIRST's Inference Gateway is a RESTful API that validates and authorizes inference requests to scientific computing clusters using [Globus Auth](https://www.globus.org/globus-auth-service) and [Globus Compute](https://www.globus.org/compute).

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](./first_architecture.png)

The Inference Gateway consists of several components:
- **API Gateway**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based [REST](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)/[Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/) API that handles authorization and request routing.
- **Globus Auth**: Authentication and authorization service.
- **Globus Compute Endpoints**: Remote execution framework on HPC clusters (or local machines).
- **Inference Server Backend**: (e.g., [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/)) High-performance inference service for LLMs running alongside the Globus Compute Endpoint.

  abstract = {We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure. Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run parallel inference workloads via an OpenAI-compliant API on private, secure environments. This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed across federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports multiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains "hot" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch and interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private, secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial cloud infrastructure.},
